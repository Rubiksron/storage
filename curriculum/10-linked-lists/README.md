## Learning Objectives
* Students will be able to implement a singly linked list
* Students will be able to implement a doubly linked list
* Students will be able create and implement common linked list methods

## Resources
* Watch [linked lists]
* Skim [linked list wiki]

## Overview
![linked-list](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/slugbyte-assets/linked-list.svg)

#### Singly Linked List
There are no FILO/FIFO-style constraints on singly linked lists
  * **FILO** - first in last out
  * **FIFO** - first in first out

Singly linked lists contain a series of nodes where each node contains a value as well as a `next` property. This property points to the next node in a line of interconnected nodes.
* operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include:
  * insertion (ie: `append` and `prepend` methods)
  * deletion (ie: `remove` method)
  * traversal (ie: `find` method)

#### Doubly Linked List
There are no FILO/FIFO-style constraints on doubly linked lists.

Doubly linked lists contain a series of nodes where each node contains a value, a `next` property, and a `prev` property.  These properties point to the previous and next node in a line of interconnected nodes.
* operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include:
  * insertion (ie: `append` and `prepend` methods)
  * deletion (ie: `remove` method)
  * traversal (ie: `find` method)
