## ORMs and ODMs
Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting relational database models to a programming language data-type using Object Oriented Programing. ORM libraries enable developers to use their programming language to control a database instead of using the database's native query language. They can help developers write cleaner and safer code, by abstracting away the complexities of database languages. Object Document Mapping (ODM) libraries function similar to ORM libraries but work with NoSQL databases that use document database models.
