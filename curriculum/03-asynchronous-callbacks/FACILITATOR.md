# Class 03

## How do I prep for today?
Review past lecture code. Pratice using the FS module, and writing helloworld async functions using setTimeout. Review the event loop video from the readme.
 
## What changed from yesterday? 
Students use `done` callbacks when testing async code. Students learn to pass data with callbacks instead of return or throw.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students struggle with the differnce between callback paramiters and arguments. When students are defining functions they ofthen wonder where the callback is coming from. You have to teach them that the callback will be provied when the function is invoked. Its a difference between definiton and usage.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Students will use return statments and throw in async code, instead of using a callback.

## General comments
Walk them through SYNC code using a stack on the whiteboard. Then Walk them through a ASYNC code using call stack, event loop, callback queue, and API diagram on the whiteboard.
